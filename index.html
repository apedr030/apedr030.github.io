        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a passionate and results-oriented professional with over 2 years of experience in the field of law. Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in organization, typing, socialization, customer service skills, and knowledge of trusts, wills, and LLC's, enabling me to contribute effectively to diverse teams and projects.

I graduated from Cypress High School which laid the foundation for my career. My journey began at Satori Law Group, where I interned and worked alongside a Real Estate Attorney, set up Trust Binders, and wrote many legal LLC papers. This role taught me the importance of legible handwriting, the neccesity of an organization system, and how important it is to write notes and I quickly realized my passion for law, more specifically Real Estate Law.

Afterward, I joined Westminester Law Group as an intern. Here, I successfully connecting with many clients and creating many trusts and will that do not need to go to probate, which resulted in a promotion and a pay raise. This experience not only strengthened my law skills but also allowed me to develop my leadership abilities as I guided a team towards achieving our goals.<br><br>

        One of my key strengths is my ability to problem solve for clients and understand their wants and needs for their wills. For example, while at Satori Law Group, I led a project that I had to create a will and trust for this wealthy couple that had many complicated assets. This initiative not only improved our processes but also fostered collaboration among team members, highlighting my commitment to teamwork and open communication.

I believe in the power of continuous learning and actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge. I have pursued many certifications, courses, and workshops, which have enhanced my expertise and kept me informed about industry trends. Staying current allows me to bring innovative ideas and solutions to my work.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am deeply committed to volunteer at the can distribution at my local church. I have volunteered with St. Irenaeus Church, where I led a group of young kids to help distribute canned goods to those in need. This experience has enriched my perspective and reinforced my belief in the importance of community engagement.<br><br>

        I am currently seeking new challenges in real estate law. I am excited about the possibility of joining a forward-thinking organization where I can leverage my skills in organization, typing, socialization, customer service skills, and knowledge of trusts and wills. I am particularly drawn to companies that push and challenge me with many projects so that I can become my fullest self, as I believe they align with my own professional aspirations.

In summary, I am a dedicated professional with a proven track record of many achievements and contributions. I am eager to contribute my unique strengths and collaborate with a dynamic team to drive success and innovation.
